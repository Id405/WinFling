# WinFling
WinFling is a windows launcher app, designed to get around the annoyances of windows search, simply run it and hit ctrl+shift+a to bring up the launcher. It will launch any files in your path (like win+r) but it also has a config file that allows you to launch files not in your path, or add quick aliases for commands to run.

Read config.example.ini on examples for how to set it up

The reccomended way to get start on boot is to make a shortcut in your startup folder with the command
```
pyw <path-to-winfling.py>
```
